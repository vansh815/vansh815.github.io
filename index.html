                <p>
                    AIVIS.AI is a startup where I have been offered a role of software-engineer team lead. I am currently leading a team of 4 people under me. AIVIS.AI is a AI solutions providing firm. I have been working at this firm for around 7 months. I have worked on various projects which included from creating data pipelines and finally deploying it on a edge devices. In the process I even successfully contributed to open source by developing solutions to train ADAM optimiser in 16 bit for tensorflow1. I even interacted with Intel engineers as I was working with intel openVino Toolkit and also gave presentations to investors for the proof of concepts made and coordinated with customers to solve the bugs if they faced any. I even worked on developing web pages for the company because of my skills in Front-end development.

            <p> 
            The decision to pursue MS was solely due to the fact that I wanted to dive deeper in the field of Data Science.I got to know various kinds of algorithms used for image processing in computer vision and was able to apply my knowldge of neural nets using Computer Vision. I learned about the hypothesis testing in Exploratory Data Analysis and Statistics and importance of different t- testing in Statistics. I got to learn the bayesian treatment of machine learning models, which was quite amazing to know about. AI subject was amaing in it's course work, I mean there were so many new and astonishing algorithms I get to know about related to search, graphs and ML. As I am from a computer science background, the thrive to become a software developer never ended. As a result of which I also took on courses related to software development too which further enhanced my knowledge. This are the following courses-works I have taken uptil now:</p>

                My Bachelor's journey has been an uphill drive, I was new to the field of computer science and so struggled with it for the initial semesters but came out strong and ended up satisfying myself of what I had aspired to be. I had earlier worked on with Android applications, for around 3 semesters. I got expertise in algorithms, data structures and databases. Then I was inspired very much by the Andrew Ng and Recommendation Systems, so decided to try on with Machine Learning and Deep Learning as I enjoyed the Math in it as well as the ability to predict an outcome, which I think was the best decision. From 5th to 8th Semester I chose various subjects related to Data-Science and Internet Of Things and also surveyed and presented many research papers related to the project topic. Some of the subjects relevant to Data Science taken are as follows : </p>

                           This project is based on idea to provide Safest route to the pedestrians. Here rather than providing the fastest route we give the fastest as well as the safest route. We used several traffic signs, traffic intensity at different times and the time required to reach a route as our weighted paramters and performed concurrent BFS to generate desired results.</p>

                           This a project based on Deep Learning and Computer Vision. We developed the model for classifying tomato diseases as healthy or diseased and if diseased, then classified them as : “early blight”,”septoria”,”bacterial spot”,“leaf mold” .We achieved an accuracy of 99.73% using transfer learning using VGGNET and applied data augmentation for increasing the size of dataset thereby minimizing overfitting .Executed different optimization methods such as linear search , randomized search, newton’s optimization technique, Adagrad ,Adam for tuning of hyper-parameters to increase accuracy .

                        <h3>Information Retrieval System</h3>
                        <p>
                            This was the subject that I took during my Bachelor's. Under this project we studied and learned various Information Retrieval methods. We used different types of pre-processing techniques such as Removal of Stop words, Tokenisation, Stemming, Lemmatisation. Tf-Idf vectorisation for encoding.We learned different types of filtering like content based ,collaborative filtering .We have also learned different types of unsupervised learning and clustering techniques.</p>
